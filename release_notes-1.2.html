      <h3>Ruport 1.2 Release Notes, 2007.08.28</h3>
      <p>This release provides a number of enhancements and updates to the 
        <b>ruport</b> package, the core library for the Ruby Reports project.
      </p><p>
        Though we aimed for high backwards compatibility with the 1.0 codebase,
        there have been some small API changes in places.  These notes will 
        show these incompatibilities as well as a sampling of the new features
        we've added.
      </p>   
      
      <h3>Install Instructions: </h3>
      
      <p>Ruport and its supporting toolset, ruport-util are packaged as gems,
        making installation trival: </p>
      
      <pre>
        gem install ruport -y
        gem install ruport-util -y
      </pre>   
      
      <p>If you're not already familiar with Ruport, you might want to have 
        a look at some <a href="examples.html">simple examples</a></p>

      <h3>Notes on backwards incompatible changes: </h3> 
      
      <p>The following features are not compatible with 1.0, and may cause 
        problems when running older Ruport code on 1.2
      </p>                                        
      
      <p><b>- acts_as_reportable now uses real association names</b></p>
      
      <p>
      In Ruport 1.0, acts_as_reportable used to do a transformation of model
      class names to name its associations in report tables.  It now uses
      the proper association name to qualify attribute names.  This will
      break any old code that relied on the earlier convention, but eliminates
      ambiguity issues.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      For example, say you had two models, Customer and CustomerAddress
      defined as follows:
      </p>
      
      <pre>
        class Customer
          has_many :addresses, :class_name => "CustomerAddress"
        end
      
        class CustomerAddress
          belongs_to :customer
        end
      </pre>
      
      <p>If you do:</p>
      
      <pre>
        Customer.report_table(:all, :include => :addresses)
      </pre>

      <p>
      Previously, the columns from CustomerAddress would have been qualified as
      customer_address.attribute_name whereas now, they would be
      addresses.attribute_name
      </p>
            
      <p><b>- Data::Table constructors now yield Data::Feeder objects</b></p>
      
      <p>You may have been using block form table constructors in your report,
         which look like this:</p>
         
      <pre>
        table = Table(%w[month year]) { |t| t << ["June",2006], ["July", 2007] } 
        
        table = Table("foo.csv") { |table,row| table << row }
      </pre>
      
      <p>
      These were mostly used to build up a table structure from some source data
      via <tt>Table#<<</tt> within a block local context.
      </p><p>
      We have now created a <tt>Data::Feeder</tt> object which allows you to
      do customized data transformations and filtering.   These new features
      are described later in these notes, but what is important here is that all
      Table constructors now yield a Data::Feeder object instead of a Table.
      </p><p>
      A default Data::Feeder#<< will behave like Data::Table#<<. so you may not
      need to modify your code if this is all it needs.
      </p><p>
      However, if you need other table methods, you will need to call 
      Data::Feeder#data to access the table object.  For example:
      <p>
      
      <pre>
        table = Table(%w[month year]) { |feeder|
          feeder << ["June",2007]
          feeder << ["July",2007]
          @months = feeder.data.column("month")       
        }
      </pre>
      
      <p>Of course, this change was meant to make life easier, not harder.  See
        the Data::Feeder examples later in these notes for details.</p>  
      
      <p><b>- Renderer::Hooks has changed</b></p>
        
      <p>In Ruport 1.0, you could do something like this to tie the formatting
      system to an arbitrary class.</p>
      
      <pre>
       class MyClass
          include Ruport::Renderer::Hooks
          renders_as_table
          
          def renderable_data
            # return some table
          end
       end
      </pre>
      
      <p>We've found that sometimes you'll want to do specialized processing
        of your data based on the intended rendering format without creating
        a custom formatter object.  To accommodate for this, we've changed the
        signature of the renderable_data hook to accept a format parameter:</p>
        
      <pre>
        class MyClass
          include Ruport::Renderer::Hooks
          renders_as_table
          
          def renderable_data(format)
            # return some table
          end
        end
      </pre>
      
      <p>The <tt>format</tt> parameter is simply the format you pass to 
        <tt>as()</tt> when you are rendering your data.  There is of course,
        no requirement to make use of the format, it is just there for your
        convenience.</p>   
       
       <p>Because rope previously generated the 1.0 compatible code, this is
         the source of incompatibility between Ruport 1.2 and any ruport-util
         release previous to 0.8.0.  If you are not using rope to generate your
         report classes, you may not need to upgrade ruport-util, though it
         is probably a good idea to do so anyway</p> 
          
      
      <h3>Examples and discussion of other changes: </h3> 
      
      <p>Nearly all of the enhancements to Ruport since 1.0 have been driven
        by real needs in our work.  Below are some examples which use
        the new features in 1.2, in no particular order</p>   
        
      <p><b>- Simplifying transformations and filters with Data::Feeder</b></p>
      
      <p>We often want to constrain our data as it is being aggregated rather
        than after we've collected it all.  Data::Feeder provides a simple
        proxy object that allows us to do exactly that.</p>
        
      <pre>
        t = Table(%w[a b c])
        feeder = Ruport::Data::Feeder.new(t)
        feeder.filter { |r| r.a < 10 }
        feeder << [1,2,3] << [9,6,1] << [11,3,2] << [2,1,7]
        t.column("a") #=> [1, 9, 2]
      </pre>    
        
      <p>You can create multiple feeders over the same source data, and define
        multiple filters on a single filter. You can also set up filters to
        work on an initial data set via the Table constructor: </p>
     
      <pre>
        t = Table(%w[a b c], :data => [[1,2,3],[9,6,1],[11,3,2],[2,1,7]],
                             :filters => lambda { |r| r.a < 10 })
        t.column("a") #=> [1,9,2]  
      </pre>   
      
      <p>You can also get back a feeder object from the Table constructor and
      build up your result set iteratively.</p>
      
      <pre>
        t = Table(%w[a b c]) do |feeder|
          feeder.filter { |r| r.a < 10 }
          feeder << [1,2,3] << [9,6,1] << [11,3,2] << [2,1,7]
        end
        t.column("a") #=> [1,9,2]  
      </pre>
      
      <p>Feeders also provide a way to do transformations on your data:</p>
     
      <pre>
        t = Table(%w[a b c])
        feeder = Ruport::Data::Feeder.new(t)
        feeder.transform { |r| r.a = "a: #{r.a}" }
        feeder << [1,2,3] << [9,6,1] << [11,3,2] << [2,1,7]
        >> t.column("a")
        => ["a: 1", "a: 9", "a: 11", "a: 2"]
      </pre>
      
      <p>Like filters, these can be specified via a :transforms option to the
        table constructor to tranform an initial data set, or used within the
        block context to alter the data iteratively.</p>
        
      <p><b>- Abstract formatting options via Formatter::Template</b></p>
      
      <p>Templates are an entirely new feature to Ruport 1.2.  They allow you
        to define a reusable set of formatting options.  You can create
        multiple templates with different options and specify which one should
        be used when output is rendered.</p>

      <p>You define a template by using the <code>create</code> method of
      	Ruport::Formatter::Template.</p>

      <pre>
        Ruport::Formatter::Template.create(:simple) do |t|
          t.page_format = {
            :size   => "LETTER",
            :layout => :landscape
          }
        end
      </pre>

      <p>When creating the template, you can specify whatever options you
        want, but your formatter needs to know what to do with them or else
        they will just be ignored.  You define an <code>apply_template</code>
        method in your formatter to tell it how to process the template.</p>

      <pre>
        class Ruport::Formatter::PDF

          def apply_template
            options.paper_size = template.page_format[:size]
            options.paper_orientation = template.page_format[:layout]
          end

        end 
      </pre>

      <p>To use a template, just specify it using the :template option when
      	you render your output.  Note that even if you've defined templates
      	and set up the formatter to use them, they are still optional.  If you
      	don't specify a :template option, <code>apply_template</code> simply
      	won't be called.</p>

      <pre>
        t = Table(%w[a b c]) << [1,2,3] << [1,4,6] << [2,3,4] 
        puts t.to_pdf(:template => :simple)  #=> uses the :simple template
        puts t.to_pdf                        #=> doesn't use a template
      </pre>

      <p>You can also derive a template from another, pre-existing
      	template, using the :base option to
      	Ruport::Formatter::Template.create.</p>

      <pre>
        Ruport::Formatter::Template.create(:derived, :base => :simple)
      </pre>

      <p>One thing that the templates have allowed us to do is to
      	standardize the interface to the different built-in formatters.  Each
      	formatter has an <code>apply_template</code> method predefined that
      	will accept a standard set of options.  If, however, you don't like
      	the predefined set up, it's easy to specify your own interface by
      	overriding the existing <code>apply_template</code> methods.  This
      	example shows a number of the options being used.</p>

      <pre>
        Ruport::Formatter::Template.create(:simple) do |t|
          t.page_format = {
            :size   => "LETTER",
            :layout => :landscape
          }
          t.text_format = {
            :font_size => 16
          }
          t.table_format = {
            :font_size      => 16,
            :show_headings  => false
          }
          t.column_format = {
            :alignment => :center,
            :heading => { :justification => :right }
          }
          t.grouping_format = {
            :style => :separated
          }
        end
      </pre>
        
      <p><b>- Sorting your Grouping objects</b></p>
      
      <p>In Ruport 1.0, Grouping objects were unordered.  Though isn't so much
        an issue for working with the objects, order often becomes significant
        in output.  We've provided a few feature enhancements to make this
        easier.</p> 
        
      <p>The most simple case is when you simply want to order your Grouping
        by the group names.</p>
        
      <pre>
        t = Table(%w[email id])
        t << ["aaa@aaa.com",1] << ["bbb@bbb.com",4] << ["aaa@aaa.com",3]
        g = Grouping(t, :by => "email", :order => :name) 
        g.to_a.map { |name,group| name } #=> ["aaa.aaa.com", "bbb@bbb.com"]
      </pre>   
      
      <p>For more complex situations, you can order by an arbitrary block.  In
        this example, we sort the groups by their size:</p>
      
      <pre>
        group_size = lambda { |g| g.size }
        g = Grouping(t, :by => "email", :order => group_size)
        g.to_a.map { |name,group| name } #=> ["bbb@bbb.com", "aaa@aaa.com"]
      </pre>
      
      <p>You can also sort the groupings after they have been created, see the 
      sort_grouping_by and sort_grouping_by! methods for details.</p>  
      
    <p><b>- Table sorting gets smarter</b></p>
    
    <p>In Ruport 1.0, Table#sort_rows_by(col) would throw an error if any nils were
    encountered.  They are now simply tacked on to the end of a result set by
    default.</p>  
    
    <p>You can also now easily specify the sort order.  If you want to reverse
    the order of sorting, just use something like this:</p>
    
    <pre>
      table.sort_rows_by(:some_column, :order => :descending)
    </pre>     
    
    <p><b>- Grouping#sigma </b><p>
      
    <p>You can now do sums across Grouping objects in the same manner as you
      do with Tables:</p>
    
    <pre>
      table = [[1,2,3],[3,4,5],[5,6,7]].to_table(%w[col1 col2 col3])
      grouping = Grouping(table, :by => "col1")
      grouping.sigma("col2") #=> 12
      grouping.sigma(0)      #=> 12
      grouping.sigma { |r| r.col2 + r.col3 } #=> 27
      grouping.sigma { |r| r.col2 + 1 } #=> 15  
    </pre> 
    
    <p>You can also use sum() instead of sigma(), they do the same thing.</p>
    
   <p><b>Easy File Output for Renderers</b></p>
         
   <p>We got tired of writing File.open(...), so our formatters now know how
     to write to file:</p>      
                                                                          
   <pre>
     Table(%w[a b c], :data => [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]).to_pdf(:file => "foo.pdf")
   </pre>
   
   <p>This doesn't cover absolutely all the changes made in Ruport 1.2, but
     hits most of the interesting ones.</p>
   
      <h3>Project news: </h3>    
      
      <p>Over the last few months, we've been busy working on a number of
        community resources.</p>  
        
      <p>We've set up <a href="http://code.rubyreports.org">code.rubyreports.org</a> as a portal for Ruport development, 
        linking all of our projects and related projects from our contributors.
        If you're working on a project that is complimentary to Ruport and want
        to share some of our resources, let us know.</p>
      
      <p>The real core of development over the last few months however has been
        The Ruport Book.  With a large chunk of its content already available
        online at ruportbook.com, this work represents the most comprehensive
        and up to date documentation for Ruport, and will give new users a much
        easier entry point than those who were with us before 1.0</p> 
        
       <p>We are self-publishing this work under a Creative Commons license,
         with printed copies available some time before the end of the year.
         If you like Ruport and find it helpful, the best way to thank us is
         to pick up a copy when it is available for sale, or 
         <a href="http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/190">donate to the documentation effort</a>.   
         We will have more details soon, but expect
         to be taking pre-orders for the printed book in the near future.
