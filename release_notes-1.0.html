      <h3>Background Information</h3>     
      <p>If you're not familiar with our project at all, you might want to
	quickly glance over the <a href="ruport.html">Overview</a> and 
	<a href="examples.html">Examples</a> pages before continuing on.</p>
	  
	<p>
	Even if you've used ruport before, you might have noticed our goals
	have evolved over time, but we've finally found an objective we think
	clearly expresses what we're trying to do:
	</p>                                      
	
	<p><em>
    The Ruby Reports project is dedicated to making your business reporting 
	life suck less (through ruby).</em></p>
	
	<p>
	Right now the project consists of three initiatives:
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>ruport : simple foundational system for reporting apps</li>
		<li>ruport-util : A set of reporting extras for ruport</li>
		<li>acts_as_reportable : Rails integration with Ruport</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>As of 2007.05.15, we can say with some confidence that the first of our
		three projects has become mature enough to be quite useful.  Ruport
		is already being used for real work, and though it is a simple system,
		it has been quite handy in practice.</p>   
		
	<h3>What's different about 1.0?</h3>
	 
	<p>If the last time you looked at Ruport was version 0.8 or earlier, you're
		in for a surprise!  Our formatting system has been enhanced in a 
		number of ways to make it quite extensible.  We also now have support 
		for row based rendering, data grouping (and rendering), and other things
		that have been on the to do list for so long.</p>
	
	<p>If you've been following the project tightly, and have used the latest
		release candidates, you won't notice a whole drove of new features,
		because we've mostly been stabilizing in preparation for 1.0.  You 
		should notice an increased stability, level of documentation, and 
		general polish on the code, though.
		
		We managed to sneak a few changes in since RC3 though. :)
	 </p>                                       
	
	 <p>All in all, we've closed every outstanding feature request ticket.
		So that means you're going to have to let us know if we missed 
		stuff!</p>
		
	 <h3>Does 1.0 Mean You're Done?</h3>
	
	 <p>Absolutely not!  However, there are some interesting changes to the
		project organization.</p>  
		
	 <p>Michael Milner will take Gregory Brown's place as lead developer 
		effective immediately.  Gregory will be maintaining the stable
		release branch of ruport, and will also be heading the development
		of ruport-util.  Mike will be overseeing the development for 
		Ruport 1.1+, as well as maintaining the acts_as_reportable rails plugin.
	 </p> 
	
	<p>On the surface, not much will change.  A new benevolent dictator will
		just create an opportunity for new ideas and project growth.  After
		almost two years, it's time for Gregory to stop obsessing over 
		Ruport anyhow.</p> 
		
	<h3>On the horizon</h3>
	
	<p>We plan to play it by ear and see what people think of Ruport 1.0 before
		we worry about new developments in the core library.  However, we're
		planning on doing a lot to augment the auxiliary libs.</p>
		
	<p>Gregory is currently working on a pair of camping apps that make use
		of Ruport heavily for commercial work.  We plan to open-source these
		soon enough, which should provide a decent working example of a 
		non-trivial Ruport based system.</p>
		
	<p>Michael still has some tricks up his sleeve for acts_as_reportable, and
		will be continuing to work on the plugin as new ideas arise.</p>
		
	<p>We'll also be working on getting any of the tools that we've developed
		that might be generally useful into ruport-util.</p>
		
	<p>As you can see, there is no shortage of things to be done! We'll also
		be working on getting you higher quality documentation and tutorials
		as soon as we can</p>
		
	<h3>Where to from here?</h3>
	
	<p>
	If you're interested in working with Ruport, you should have a look
	at some of the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> we have available
	to users and contributors.  Our best resource is certainly our 
	<a href="http://list.rubyreports.org">mailing list</a>, so please stop
	by and let us know what you think!
	</p> 
	
	<p>
	Also, please have a look at the 
	<a href="http://stonecode.svnrepository.com/ruport/trac.cgi/wiki/Acknowledgements">
	long list of folks</a> who have directly
	contributed to Ruport.  Without them, we'd never have made it to 1.0.
